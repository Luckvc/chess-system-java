## Project description 

<p>

  Project developed in Java, fully working chess system through console. 
  
  Coded along with Nelio Alves course.

## What I learned?
 
 With this project, I learned through practical application the three pillars of Object-Oriented Programming: Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism, thus consolidating my theoretical knowledge.

## What does it look like?

## The Future
  
  The base program is done(I believe), the following implementations would be to create an interface and host it so you can play online. 
  
  Feel free to create issues, contribute or make sugestions. I'm still on the beginnig of my journey as a developer and I can use all the help I can get.
